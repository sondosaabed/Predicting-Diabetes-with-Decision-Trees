# Predicting Diabetes with Decision Trees: using Java, JavaFX and WEKA

A (diabetes risk of having) prediction model was built on this project. With the motive of assisting in the early diagnosis of diabetes in Palestinian healthcare. The project was built using maven project utilized WEKA in building the decision tree model and JavaFX in building GUI. To select the better performing model two splitting rules were performed and model 2 the one that uses the 50:50 splitting rule was found to be better and was selected to predict diabetes.
